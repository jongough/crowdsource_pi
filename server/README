# Crowdsource server

This subdirectory contains a simple server for the crowdsource plugin written in python. To run it:

```
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

Note that the server uses a relative path to open the avro protocol specification file, and so relies on this subdirectory being the current directory when run.
